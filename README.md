# standalone-app-CMSI2022: Cool Destinations
This project was the 1st of 4 completed for the LMU CMSI2022: Mobile App Development Class in conjunction with **Bryan Ardon**, user: **bryanardon**.

Our group was affectionately known as ***A Tuple of Bools***.

The following is from the original project description:
## Overlook
We built an app that allows users to track Cool Destinations where they would like to travel. We give the users a home screen that allows them to search for a country that starts with an A. Once the user selects a country, they are able to see the destinations this country offers and mark if they have visited this country before. We also have a profile where the user can edit their name and next travel date.

## Difficulties
The implementation of the Destination substructure inside the Country structure was an interesting hurdle, along with overall Map generation and scaling. Due to our difficulty in finding a dataset with all the information we wanted, we decided to stick with countries only beginning with "A."

## Potential Bugs
The profile structure, despite functioning properly earlier, functions in the ProfileEditor file but not in the ProfileHost file. It was working on Bryan's system previously, however it began to malfunction with no alterations.

## Credits
We borrowed our flag photos from this source:
